# 🚗 Car Brands Classification using Custom CNN

This project focuses on classifying car images into different brands using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built from scratch. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in identifying car brands based on visual features.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Task**: Multi-class image classification
- **Dataset**: Images of cars belonging to various brands (e.g., BMW, Audi, Mercedes, Toyota, etc.)
- **Model**: Custom CNN architecture (without using pre-trained models)
- **Framework**: PyTorch (or TensorFlow/Keras if that's your choice)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Loss, Confusion Matrix, Grad-CAM Visualizations

## 🏗️ CNN Model Architecture

The custom CNN model consists of several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for classification. ReLU activations and batch normalization are used to improve performance.
