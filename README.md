# 🚗 Car Brands Classification using Custom CNN

This project focuses on classifying car images into different brands using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built from scratch. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in identifying car brands based on visual features.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Task**: Multi-class image classification
- **Dataset**: Images of cars belonging to various brands (e.g., BMW, Audi, Mercedes, Toyota, etc.)
- **Model**: Custom CNN architecture (without using pre-trained models)
- **Framework**: PyTorch (or TensorFlow/Keras if that's your choice)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Loss, Confusion Matrix, Grad-CAM Visualizations
